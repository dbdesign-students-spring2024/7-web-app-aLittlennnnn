# Flask-MongoDB Web App

## About my app
The app that I created is called [**Rate your course!**](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~yw6157/7-web-app-aLittlennnnn/flask.cgi) <br>
It's a platform where students at NYU can upload their comments and ratings on the course they've taken.
There are three main pages to this webapp:<br>
1. The [home page](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~yw6157/7-web-app-aLittlennnnn/flask.cgi) that displays a welcome message and links to the other two pages.
2. The ["Course Forum"](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~yw6157/7-web-app-aLittlennnnn/flask.cgi/read) where all the created comments can be *Read*, *Edited* and *deleted*.
3. The ["Rate a course"](https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~yw6157/7-web-app-aLittlennnnn/flask.cgi/create) page where a user can *create* a comment with the name of the course, professor of the course, rating and comment by choosing the school providing the course and the type of the course from a drop down menu.
